Why do you give it all to them?
They got shiny guns shoot em just for fun but they'd rather have you dead
Oh can't you see you're a shade of green and they plan to paint you red
Fabricating lies and drugs to keep you in your bed
We fuel the world they run but most of us don't know
Day by day and one by one the fire starts to grow
So if you're with me raise your fist up to the sky
Let them hear around the world
We will never die!
You! you're the bullet of the gun
Tear down the walls exposing everyone
You're the gears that grind
Crank up the speed don't stop until it's done
They'll crash and burn when you show the world
that they speak in silver tongues
We'll beat and break them down together we are one
This is our moment raise your fist up to the sky
From now until the end of time
Never die!
Every day of my life is another curse
It hurts to live yet I don’t wanna die
In and out of crime, time is no friend of mine
To save me would just be a lie
Cause I’m a cowboy til death, born to rule the old west
For the devil has taken my soul
My heart is black as coal and I am out of control
I’m a no good, killing kind of man
Ill take your money, your women, til I’m the last man standing
Last man standing
Yeah, til I’m the last man standing
Every scar on my face has a story to tell
But they all end with blood on my hands
The vultures feed while they can, til there’s no trace of man
And then I ride like a ghost in the wind
I’ll steal your women, I like my widows in duress
They taste like all woman should
They’ll be my bitches tonight, and I won’t treat them right
I’m a cheating, stealing, kind of man, Yes I am
Every day of my life is an evil curse
It tries to kill me but I cannot die
I try to ease the pain while I go insane
By cursing all those who stand in my way
I’m a cowboy, a cowboy til death
I’ll be the last man standing
I need your love
You can't resist my touch
Call on me baby
I'm goin crazy
Give it to me, the love abuse
You know I can't refuse
Don't stop til I'm black and blue
There's no one else like you
I need you now
I need you more than ever
If only time could stop forever
You're the one I want
You're the one I need (yeah yeah yeah)
I'm the only one who can cure your love disease
But baby babe I'll make you come for me
Love ain't free
I like it when you're rough
I cannot get enough
And when you're far away
I'm thinkin bout the love we made
We were made to be together
Sweet taste of poison cures, but satisfaction burns
Behind the mushroom cloud, sounds of the roaring crowd
Live fast, play hard, die young that's what I like to do
My face so numb I feel electric groove
Deep fried brains and a bottle of jack
A plastic burger and a heart attack
I just drift away
Drift away to the sky
Life just slips away
I've never felt so high
My nose bleeds cherry red, my mind has left my head
Blood pressure boiling hot, oh there's jesus in the parking lot
My face, my nose is numb electric groove
I get dank like you've never had, I get high like you never have,
I get laid like you never have
Because I get it from your mom and dad
A little man whispers in my ear
What's he trying to say to me?
He speaks the words "love conquers fear"
A sense of peace rushes over me
I'm in a frame of mind, Don't want the normal grind
Need something to unwind
My money's on this game,
Diablo is his name
He's got a grip on my veins
He fucks around with me, He likes to make me bleed
He wants to rule and kill me
Someone save me
I feel alone again
Trapped as the walls close in
Why do I feel this way?
Why don't you feel the same?
I'm on the streets again, Stealin my saving plan
The high my only friend
And when I look around, Strangers just stare me down
I'm feelin beat to the ground
And when they look at me I wonder if they see
The beast inside of me
I'm feeling weak today, My sky is dark and gray
I need a fix in the worst way
The pressure's got me down, I think I'm gonna drown
I'm fighting for my life
There is another way, A second chance per se
It's time to destroy the game
I've waited for this day to come just flap your lips and get you some
I see you walking up to me so bring it boy I'll set you free
Speak to me you might regret my hate for you you'll never forget
Talk your shit it won't last long I'll beat you down it can't be wrong
Get it on
You will feel my pain
I'm gonna brand you with my name
You don't know just what you do
Empty words that's all I get my love for you I've learned to regret
Using sex that's what you do it brings me down my balls are blue
I’ve gotta make a change today it’s time for me to dominate
I see you struttin up to me I’ll bang you up to set me free
All I want is some peace of mind
Oh wont you give me a sign
All I need is a yes or no
Oh wont you please let me go
I'm addicted to your games
You’ve got my balls in chains
But maybe I don't wanna leave
You’re the only one who sets me free
I've never felt so right
I don’t wanna let you go
If I'm the one then let me know
It's now or never
Tell me I'm the one you need
Leave it all and come with me
Now or never
Now or never baby
I love all things that you do
You make me feel good
Oh baby don’t you understand
That I’m your back door man
You need me you cannot lie
You wanna play my game
I want my love on you
Time for revolution
It’s knockin at your door
Will you fight for the future
Or send your children off to war
Gotta stand for the free land
Cause were barely hangin on
No one said it was easy
To make peace without a bomb
All I ever see is wasted time and broken dreams
Staring back at me
Don’t forget what you’re fighting for
The war is knockin at your door
Join the fight and change the world
It’s time for revolution
We are slaves to the system
We live like blinded sheep
Listen to the leaders speak
Feeding fear for a ton of money
Crack the bell and start the fight
Or live your life in misery
Don’t forget about who you are
Lines are drawn out in the sand, loaded weapons in our hands
Why destroy what we create, in the blink of an eye we seal our fate
We only see what we believe, blinded by our lust for greed
Will we ever find our way?
In the end
Our battle rages on and on, days of hate are far from gone
Discontent so plain to see, so many lives in misery
If we change will we survive, darkness drowns out all our cries
Nothing left to put our faith in
Only got one chance to make it
Nothing’s worse than what we’re facing
Is this life we live worth saving?
In the end were all the same
Were never gonna change our ways
In the end were all to blame
For all of the mistakes we've made
